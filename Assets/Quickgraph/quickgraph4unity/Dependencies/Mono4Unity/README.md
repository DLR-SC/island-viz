mono4unity
=============================
This project adds to the [Unity game engine] (http://unity3d.com) some [Mono] (https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/mcs/class) classes that aren't available because Unity's using an old Mono release. 

This project, as the original Mono project, has been released using the MIT license and it will probably become unnecessary once Unity starts using more recent Mono releases.
